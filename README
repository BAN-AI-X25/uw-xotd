An X.25 over TCP interface for UnixWare, rfc1613, "xot".

Provides a TLI interface, with optional extension for Q packets.

A server, xotlink, waits for incoming TCP calls and links them
to the xot driver.

When the xot driver needs to make an outgoing TCP call it asks xotlink
to establish the call.  When xotlink is done it links the call to the
xot driver.

When xot is finished with the tcp connection it asks xotlink to clear
the call.

The xotlink configuration file, read on standard input is a list of
xot devices and the matching remote ip address:

/dev/xot1/000	cisco1
/dev/xot2/000	cisco2

To make/accept an X.25 call via "cisco2" the user would code:

	int fd;
	fd = t_open ("/dev/xot2p", O_RDWR);
	...
	
then t_connect/t_accept as necessary.

BUGS: 

For some reason if the first open of the xot device is not a clone open
and the driver is not already loaded it gets the major device number
wrong?!@  Quick & dirty fix - "modadmin -l" the driver first.

The Makefile is a gnu Makefile.

The Makefile assumes you want to install the driver in
/maint/modules/xot from where a "make install" will do the
idinstall/idbuild.

I'm too lazy to make a real package.
